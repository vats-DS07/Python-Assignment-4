NumPy, is a basic package for scientific computing with Python. It is a library that provides a multidimensional array object and tools for working with these arrays.

Key Features of NumPy:

High-Performance N-dimensional Arrays: The ndarray object is faster and more compact than Python lists.

Broadcasting: This allows for arithmetic operations on arrays of different shapes, super useful for matrix math.

Vectorization: Operations can be performed on entire arrays without explicitly writing loops, for example, arr * 2 would multiply every element by 2. Integration: It's easily integrated with C/C++ and Fortran code, which allows it to be blazingly fast.
