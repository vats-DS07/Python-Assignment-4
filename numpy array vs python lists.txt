Numpy Array: 

1) It stores data in continuous block and hence uses less RAM.

2) Optimized code execution and efficient for larger datasets 

3) All the elements must be of same type

4) Built-in function for algebra, matrices, statistics

Python Lists:
1) Stores pointers to objects, hence high RAM usage 

2) Python interpretation makes looping slow 

3) Can store mixed datatypes like (int, float , str , bool) in a single list

4) Good for general data storage but lacks complex math functions
